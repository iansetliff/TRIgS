# BioTools
A collection of bioinformatics tools for sequence analysis, with an emphasis on Next-Generation Sequencing and [Rep-Seq](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22043864 "Rep-Seq").


[**AnnotateTree**](docs/AnnotateTree.md) creates annotated lineage trees and sequence alignments showing the point at which amino acid substitutions occur. It uses [PHYLIPâ€™s dnaml](http://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip.html) for ancestral reconstruction. Sequence numbering can be defined by the user, for example to match the numbering of a crystal structure, or to match a standard numbering scheme. If the sequences represent a B-cell clonal lineage, additional reports relating to variation in the CDRs can be produced. An [online version](http://cimm.ismb.lon.ac.uk/pat/annotatetree/) is available.

[**RevertToGermline**](docs/RevertToGermline.md) uses a simple approach to infer the germline ancestor of a B-cell variable region sequence, given the IMGT junction analysis. If a clonal lineage is available, the inferred germline can be used to root a phylogenetic tree, from which a more accurate germline can then be inferred using AnnotateTree. An [online version](http://cimm.ismb.lon.ac.uk/pat/germline/) is available.

[**IgBLASTPlus**](docs/IgBLASTPlus.md) processes the output from NCBI's [IgBLAST]("http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/igblast/"),
providing a full junction analysis and summarising results in an [IMGT]("http://imgt.org")-style tab-separated format. 

[**ExtractFromImgt**](docs/ExtractFromImgt.md) is a flexible tool for extracting sequences from IMGT/IgBLASTPlus files.
